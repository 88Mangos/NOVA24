MSDS Parser: Leverages GenAI to summarize Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for laboratory work and other potentially dangerous substances. 
It succinctly summarizes what to do during emergencies, which improves laboratory safety - under the stress of an emergency situation, few people can read an entire tedious MSDS
and know exactly how to respond. 

We've provided some MSDS examples from Sigma Aldrich that can be uploaded to the UI. You can learn all about what to do when working with acetone or salicylic acid!
